Ryan O'Donell 4.7: Small "width" (degree for Fourier stuff) corresponds to low total influence (so less senstiive). 
4.9: One can approximate functions with s DNF terms with a function with log(s/\epsilon) terms by deleting everything larger.

By combining Proposition 4.9 and Corollary 4.8 we can deduce (using Exercise 3.17) that DNFs of size s have Fourier spectra ²-concentrated up to degree
O(log(s/²)/²). Again, the dependence on ² will be improved in Section 4.4. We will also later show in Section 4.3 that size-s DNFs have total influence at most O(log s), something we cannot deduce immediately from Proposition 4.7.
